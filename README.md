Learning css frameworks with Bootstrap 4
Result:

Layout we had to follow without CSS:

What went well:
  - Quickly discovered the 'Card' templates
  - After getting the hang of Bootstrap 4 things went less slow
  - Very quick startup off a website
  
What went wrong:
  - Difficult library of Bootstrap 4 made it hard to find solutions
  - Due to many people using CSS in their examples it was hard to find the right command
  - Discovered 'Card Decks' after I had made my grid
  - Working on clumsy (in bootstrap 4) finishing  took me a lot of time
